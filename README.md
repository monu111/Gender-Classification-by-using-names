# Gender-Classification-by-using-names
## In this project, we can predict that gender is male or female by using their name. I performed text preprocessing and selected the best model for this use case.


*1. Here we have made a model that the predict the gender by using their name.*
 
*2. In Modeling I have used MultinomialNB and LSTM model.*
 
*3. The LSTM model performed well for this problem statement. So i selected LSTM to make prediction and I achieved 90% accuracy.which is better for this use case.*
